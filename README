== Concept ==

* Undirected Graph
* Swarms that can inact single implement action per phase
* Actions implemeted via Command design pattern
* Undo method must be also implemented, and can be verified by checking graphs state, enacting swarm's action,
  undoing, and verifying state hasn't changed

== NODE ==
* Has Many Edges
* Has Single Stack of Strings
* Do not act

== EDGE ==
* Belongs to two nodes
** No uniqueness constraint
* Has one or more "Types"
** Therefore two nodes could be connected by both a "'Yellow'+'Railroad'" edge and a "'Scary'+'Tunnel'" edge
* Do not act

== SWARM ==
* Exist on a single node
* Can do a single action per turn
** Try / Undo / Commit
* Graph Permissions
** Can see who resides at current node
** Can see current node's edges' types
** Can see where current node's edges go to
*** Can not see the contents or edges of neighboring nodes
** Can pop / push on node's string stack
